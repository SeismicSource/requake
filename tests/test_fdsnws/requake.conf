#### Station metadata and waveform data

## Use a full URL or an ObsPy shortcut (e.g., IRIS, RESIF, GEOFON, ...)
fdsn_station_url = RESIF
## Alternatively, you can provide the path to a local file with station
## metadata in any format supported by ObsPy (note that some formats may not
## contain station coordinates, which are required for the scan, see
## https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.inventory.inventory.read_inventory.html)
## If both fdsn_station_url and station_metadata_path are provided, the
## local file will be used.

## FDSN dataselect webservice URL to retrieve waveforms.
## Use a full URL or an ObsPy shortcut (e.g., IRIS, RESIF, GEOFON, ...)

## Alternatively, you can provide the path to a local SDS waveform archive
## (see https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.clients.filesystem.sds.html)
sds_data_path = None
## Or, specify a local directory with waveform files organized per event
## This directory should contain subdirectories named after the eventid, each
## containing waveform files in any format supported by ObsPy
## (e.g., SAC, miniSEED). The eventid should be the same as in the catalog.

#### Catalog-based scan
### The following parameters are for a catalog-based scan:
### each catalog event is compared with the other catalog events within
### a certain distance range. Similarity is checked by waveform
### cross-correlation at one or more stations.
### To perform a catalog-based scan use:
###    requake scan_catalog
## FDSN event webservice URL to retrieve event catalogs.
## Use a full URL or an ObsPy shortcut (e.g., IRIS, RESIF, GEOFON, ...)
catalog_fdsn_event_url = IPGP
## start time for event selection (UTC date time)
catalog_start_time = 2022-10-10T00:00:00
## end time for event selection (UTC date time or 'now')
catalog_end_time = 2022-10-20T00:00:00
## Optionally, up to three other sources can be defined for different
## time intervals

## geographic selection (decimal degrees)
catalog_lat_min = 14.25

catalog_lon_min = -60.9
catalog_lon_max = -60.6
## depth selection (km, positive down)
catalog_depth_min = 0.0

## magnitude selection

## maximum epicentral distance range to search for similar earthquakes
## (radius, km)
catalog_search_range = 30.0
## trace id(s) to compute cross-correlation, in NET.STA.LOC.CHAN format.
## Waveform data for this trace(s) id will be retrieved using the station
## webservice.
## If more than one trace_id is specified (separated by commas), the closest
## station will be used for a given event pair.
catalog_trace_id = WI.BIM.00.HHZ

#### Template-based scan
### The following parameters are for template-based scan:
### A template is used to search for similar waveforms at a given station
### over a given time interval.
### To perform a template-based scan use:
###    requake scan_templates
## start time for template search (UTC date time)
template_start_time = 2021-08-23T00:00:00
## end time for event template search (UTC date time or 'now')
template_end_time = 2021-08-24T00:00:00
## Time chunk (in seconds) to analyze continuous data.
## Large values (1 hour or more) will result in fewer data requests and
## faster execution. However, cross-correlation can be slow for too large
## values. No more than one event per time chunk can be detected, so the
## length of time chunk should be smaller than the minimum inter-event time
## you want to detect.
time_chunk = 3600.0
## Overlap between time chunks (in seconds)
time_chunk_overlap = 60.0
## Minimum ratio between cross-correlation (cc) and median absolute deviation
## (MAD) of cross-correlation (cc_mad). A detection is declared when:
##  cc/cc_mad > min_cc_mad_ratio
min_cc_mad_ratio = 50.0

#### Processing parameters
## Seconds before P arrival to cut trace
## (only used for catalog search and continuous data)

## Clustering algorithm to create families of similar events.
## Possible options are:
##  shared : families are created by clustering all event pairs sharing
##           an event
##  UPGMA : families are created through the Unweighted Pair Group Method
##          with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) algorithm
##          (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPGMA)
clustering_algorithm = shared
## Search for anticorrelated events (negative CC)
cc_allow_negative = False
## How families should be sorted when assigning family numbers.
## Possible options are:
##  time : increasing origin time of first event in family (default option)
##  longitude : increasing longitude
##  latitude : increasing latitude
##  depth : increasing depth
##  distance_from : increasing horizontal distance from a given point
sort_families_by = time
## Longitude and latitude of reference point,
## if sort_families_by = 'distance_from'
distance_from_lon = None
distance_from_lat = None
## Templates are built by averaging the traces in the family.
## Set the following parameter to True if you want to normalize the traces
## before averaging.
## Normalization will produce an average trace which is more representative
## of the family, but will be less effective in reducing noise.
normalize_traces_before_averaging = False
