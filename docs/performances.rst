* ``requake scan_catalog`` took 53 minutes on my 2.7 GHz i7 MacBook Pro to
  process 14,100,705 earthquake pairs.
  Dowloaded traces are cached in memory to speed up execution. Processing is not
  yet parallel: some improvements might come in future versions, when
  parallelization will be implemented.

* ``requake build_families`` is fastâ„¢.
